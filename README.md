# pollen-grain-classifier
A Flask web app that classifies pollen grain images using a CNN model.
 🌸 Pollen Grain Classifier

A Flask-based machine learning project that classifies pollen grain images into six flower types:
*Hibiscus, Lavender, Lilly, Lotus, Rose, and Sunflower.*

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses a *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* model trained on pollen grain images.
The trained model is integrated with *Flask* to create a simple and user-friendly web interface.

---

## 🏗️ Project Flow
1. *User uploads* a pollen grain image.  
2. The image is *preprocessed* and passed to the trained CNN model.  
3. The model predicts the *flower type*.  
4. The *result is displayed* on the web interface.
